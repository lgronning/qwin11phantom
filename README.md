## Phantom Style

QWin11Phantom is a Windows 11 QStyle for Qt which is built on PhantomStyle https://github.com/randrew/phantomstyle.

* [Usage](#usage)
* [Compatibility](#compatibility)
* [License](#license)
* [TODO](#todo)

## Usage

### Built into an application

Add `src/style/style.pri` to your qmake .pro file for your project. There
are no additional dependencies. It's also safe to construct a QWin11PhantomStyle
object before instantiating a QApplication, because it doesn't interact with
the environment or anything else.

### As a QStylePlugin

A style plugin is available: [qwin11phantomstyleplugin.pro](src/styleplugin/qwin11phantomstyleplugin.pro)

## Compatibility

Tested on Qt 5.15 and later, but should work on earlier versions as well. Builds
with MSVC (tested with 2017), GCC and clang.

Uses `auto` from C++11, so C++11 is needed. C++14 and later are not needed.

## License

LGPL 2.1.

## TODO

* A few things still needs to be done. Any cotribution is very welcome
